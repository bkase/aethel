## Analysis of the Momentum GitHub Actions Workflow

Based on my analysis of the CI workflow and Makefile, here are the key findings:

### 1. **Configuration to Ignore Markdown/Docs Changes**

The workflow uses `paths-ignore` to skip CI runs when only documentation is modified:

```yaml
paths-ignore:
  - 'docs/**'
  - 'todos/**'
  - 'CLAUDE.md'
  - '*.md'
```

This configuration applies to both `push` and `pull_request` events, ensuring CI doesn't run unnecessarily for documentation-only changes.

### 2. **Commands Run by CI**

The CI workflow runs these commands for Rust (which would be relevant for aethel):

- **Test**: `make rust-test` → `cargo test`
- **Lint**: `make rust-lint` → 
  - `cargo fmt -- --check` (formatting check)
  - `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (linting with warnings as errors)
- **Build**: `make rust-build` → `cargo build --release`

### 3. **Other Relevant Configuration**

- **Runner**: Uses `macos-14` (GitHub's macOS runner)
- **Tool Management**: Uses `mise` for managing tool versions
- **Caching**: Caches Cargo dependencies for faster builds:
  ```yaml
  path: |
    ~/.cargo/bin/
    ~/.cargo/registry/index/
    ~/.cargo/registry/cache/
    ~/.cargo/git/db/
    momentum/target/
  key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
  ```
- **Rust Setup**: Installs rustfmt and clippy components via rustup
- **Binary Verification**: Checks that the release binary was built successfully

### Key Takeaways for Aethel

For the aethel project, you should consider implementing:

1. A similar `paths-ignore` configuration to skip CI for documentation changes
2. A Makefile with standard targets for `test`, `lint`, and `build`
3. Cargo caching to speed up CI runs
4. Using `mise` for consistent tool versions across development and CI
5. Running both `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy` for code quality
6. Building release binaries to ensure optimized builds work

The momentum project has a more complex setup due to its Swift components, but the Rust-specific parts provide a good template for aethel's CI configuration.

## Summary

Based on my analysis of the aethel project:

1. **No GitHub Actions workflow exists** - There is no `.github/workflows/` directory in the current project structure.

2. **No Makefile exists** - There is no Makefile in the project root.

The project appears to be a Rust-based CLI tool with the following structure:
- Standard Rust project layout with `Cargo.toml` and `src/` directory
- Multiple command modules (doctor, get, grow, init, new)
- Core components for configuration, indexing, models, registry, and storage
- Documentation in `docs/` directory
- Project guidance in `CLAUDE.md`

This means the project currently relies on standard Cargo commands for building, testing, and other development tasks, but lacks:
- Automated CI/CD workflows
- A Makefile for common development tasks
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and quality checks

Based on my analysis of the Aethel project structure and Cargo.toml, here's what I found:

## Project Structure
- **Single Rust crate**: The project is a simple Rust binary crate named "aethel"
- **No workspace**: This is not a Cargo workspace with multiple crates
- **Standard src layout**: All source files are in the `src/` directory with a modular structure

## Key Build Requirements from Cargo.toml
1. **Rust Edition**: 2021
2. **Major Dependencies**:
   - `tokio` with full features (async runtime)
   - `sqlx` with SQLite support (requires runtime-tokio)
   - `clap` for CLI parsing
   - `git2` for Git operations
   - Various serialization libraries (serde, serde_json, serde_yaml)
   - Error handling (thiserror, anyhow)
   - Logging (tracing, tracing-subscriber)

## Makefile Requirements

Based on the project structure and dependencies, the Makefile should include:

1. **Standard Cargo Commands**:
   - `cargo build` - Build the project
   - `cargo build --release` - Build optimized release version
   - `cargo test` - Run tests
   - `cargo clippy` - Run the Rust linter
   - `cargo fmt` - Format code

2. **Special Considerations**:
   - **SQLx**: The project uses SQLx which may require database setup for offline query verification
   - **Environment Variables**: Support for `RUST_LOG` for debugging (as mentioned in CLAUDE.md)
   - **Feature Flags**: No custom features defined in Cargo.toml, so no special feature configurations needed

3. **Additional Useful Targets**:
   - `cargo check` - Quick syntax/type checking without full build
   - `cargo doc` - Generate documentation
   - `cargo clean` - Clean build artifacts
   - Combined targets for CI (e.g., format check, clippy, test in sequence)

The Makefile should be straightforward since this is a standard Rust binary project without complex build requirements or custom features.
