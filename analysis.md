## Analysis of the 'new' Command Implementation

Based on my examination of the aethel codebase, here are the key findings about the 'new' command:

### 1. Command Definition (src/cli.rs)

The 'new' command is defined as a subcommand with the following parameters:

- **`--type` / `-t`** (Required): The type of artifact to create (e.g., "note", "core_note/schema")
- **`--title`** (Optional): Title for the artifact
- **`--field` / `-f`** (Optional, Multiple): Additional fields as key=value pairs
- **`--body`** (Optional): Body content for the artifact

### 2. Command Implementation Flow (src/commands/new.rs)

The implementation follows these steps:

1. **Configuration Loading**: Loads the aethel configuration to get the vault path
2. **Registry Loading**: Loads the plugin registry to verify the artifact type exists
3. **Type Parsing**: Parses the artifact type, defaulting to "core_note" plugin if no plugin is specified
4. **Plugin Validation**: Verifies the specified plugin exists in the registry
5. **Artifact Creation**: Creates the artifact with:
   - Generated UUID (v4)
   - Current timestamp for created_at and updated_at
   - Schema version "1.0"
   - Empty tags array
   - Extra fields from title and custom fields
6. **File Path Generation**: Creates a hierarchical path structure:
   - Base: `20_artifacts/{plugin_id}/{YYYY}/{MM}/`
   - Filename: `{DD}T{HH}-{MM}-{SS}Z.md`
7. **Artifact Writing**: Serializes and writes the artifact as YAML frontmatter + markdown content
8. **Index Update**: Inserts the artifact UUID and file path into the SQLite index
9. **Output**: Prints only the UUID for scripting compatibility

### 3. Artifact Structure

Artifacts are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
uuid: <generated-uuid>
type: <artifact-type>
createdAt: <timestamp>
updatedAt: <timestamp>
tags: []
schemaVersion: "1.0"
title: <optional-title>
<additional-fields>: <values>
---
<body-content>
```

### 4. Key Validation Points

- **Plugin Existence**: The command validates that the specified plugin exists in the registry
- **Directory Creation**: Parent directories are created automatically if they don't exist
- **Type Format**: Supports both simple types (e.g., "note") and qualified types (e.g., "plugin/schema")

### 5. Error Handling

The command can fail with several specific errors:
- `PluginNotFound`: If the specified plugin doesn't exist
- `VaultNotFound`: If the vault path is invalid
- `Sqlx`: Database errors when updating the index
- `Io`: File system errors when writing the artifact
- `Yaml`: Serialization errors

### 6. Notable Features

- **Flexible Field System**: The `--field` parameter allows arbitrary key-value pairs to be added to the artifact metadata
- **Body Content Support**: The `--body` parameter allows initial content to be provided when creating the artifact
- **Timestamp-Based Organization**: Files are organized chronologically by year/month directories
- **Git-Native Design**: The file structure is designed to work well with Git versioning
- **Minimal Output**: Returns only the UUID for easy integration with shell scripts and automation

This implementation provides a clean, extensible way to create new artifacts in the aethel vault with proper indexing and organization.
## Analysis of the 'grow' Command Implementation

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are the key findings about the 'grow' command:

### Command Structure

The 'grow' command is defined in `src/cli.rs` as a subcommand with the following structure:

```rust
/// Append content to an existing artifact
Grow {
    /// UUID of the artifact
    #[arg(long)]
    uuid: String,

    /// Content to append
    #[arg(long)]
    content: String,
},
```

### Parameters

The command takes exactly two required parameters:
- `--uuid`: A string representing the UUID of the artifact to append to
- `--content`: The content string to append to the artifact

Both parameters must be provided using long-form arguments (e.g., `--uuid <UUID> --content "content to append"`).

### Implementation Flow

The implementation in `src/commands/grow.rs` follows this sequence:

1. **Configuration Loading**: Loads the aethel configuration to get the vault path
2. **UUID Validation**: Parses the provided UUID string and validates it's a proper UUID format
3. **Database Lookup**: Queries the SQLite index to find the file path for the given UUID
4. **Artifact Reading**: Reads the existing artifact from disk using the retrieved file path
5. **Content Appending**: 
   - If the artifact already has content, adds two newlines (`\n\n`) as a separator
   - Appends the new content to the existing content
6. **Timestamp Update**: Updates the `updated_at` timestamp in the artifact's frontmatter
7. **Write Back**: Writes the modified artifact back to the same file path
8. **Silent Success**: Returns without output on success (for better scripting compatibility)

### Validation and Error Handling

The command performs several validations:
- **Invalid UUID Format**: Returns `AethelError::InvalidUuid` if the UUID string can't be parsed
- **Artifact Not Found**: Returns `AethelError::ArtifactNotFound` if no artifact exists with the given UUID
- **Vault Not Found**: Returns `AethelError::VaultNotFound` if the configured vault path doesn't exist
- **File I/O Errors**: Propagates any file reading/writing errors

### Data Structure

The artifact being modified follows this structure:
- **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata including UUID, type, timestamps, tags, and custom fields
- **Content**: Markdown body content stored as a string

The artifact is stored in a markdown file with YAML frontmatter delimited by `---`.

### Key Design Aspects

1. **Append-Only**: The command only appends content; it doesn't allow editing or removing existing content
2. **Automatic Formatting**: Automatically adds spacing between existing and new content
3. **Timestamp Management**: Automatically updates the `updated_at` field to track modifications
4. **Database Index**: Uses SQLite to maintain a fast lookup index mapping UUIDs to file paths
5. **Silent Operation**: Designed for scripting - no output on success, only errors are reported

This implementation makes the 'grow' command ideal for incrementally building artifacts over time, such as adding entries to a journal, notes to a research document, or events to a log.
## Analysis of Existing Patterns for Implementing the 'Write' Command

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are the relevant patterns that would help guide the implementation of a unified 'write' command:

### 1. **Command Structure Patterns**

The project uses clap's derive API with a consistent pattern:
- Commands are defined as enum variants in `cli.rs`
- Each command has its own execution function in a separate module under `src/commands/`
- Optional parameters use `Option<T>` with `#[arg(long)]`
- Required parameters are plain types

### 2. **Optional vs Required Parameters**

Looking at the existing commands:
- **New command**: Has optional `title` and `body` parameters using `Option<String>`
- **Grow command**: Has required `uuid` and `content` parameters
- **Get command**: Has a required `uuid` but optional `format` with a default value

Pattern for optional parameters:
```rust
#[arg(long)]
title: Option<String>,
```

Pattern for required parameters:
```rust
#[arg(long)]
uuid: String,
```

### 3. **Conditional Behavior Based on Existence**

The codebase already demonstrates patterns for checking if something exists:
- **Grow command**: Checks if an artifact exists by UUID before appending
- Uses `get_artifact_path()` which returns `Option<String>`
- Returns `ArtifactNotFound` error if the artifact doesn't exist

Example pattern:
```rust
let file_path = get_artifact_path(&pool, &uuid)
    .await?
    .ok_or_else(|| AethelError::ArtifactNotFound(uuid_str.to_string()))?;
```

### 4. **Error Handling Patterns**

The project uses a custom `AethelError` enum with thiserror:
- Specific error variants for different scenarios (e.g., `ArtifactNotFound`, `InvalidUuid`)
- Consistent use of `Result<T>` type alias
- Early returns with `?` operator

### 5. **Command Execution Pattern**

All commands follow this pattern:
1. Load configuration
2. Get vault path
3. Validate inputs
4. Perform the main operation
5. Update the index if needed
6. Return appropriate output

### 6. **Unified Write Command Design Recommendations**

Based on these patterns, a unified 'write' command could:

1. **Use optional UUID parameter** to determine create vs append:
   ```rust
   Write {
       /// UUID of existing artifact (if appending)
       #[arg(long)]
       uuid: Option<String>,
       
       /// Type of artifact to create (required for new artifacts)
       #[arg(long, short = 't')]
       r#type: Option<String>,
       
       /// Content to write
       #[arg(long)]
       content: String,
       
       // Other optional fields for new artifacts
       #[arg(long)]
       title: Option<String>,
       
       #[arg(long = "field", short = 'f', value_parser = parse_key_val)]
       fields: Vec<(String, String)>,
   }
   ```

2. **Implement conditional logic** in the execute function:
   - If `uuid` is provided → append to existing (like current `grow`)
   - If `uuid` is None → create new (like current `new`)
   - Validate that `type` is required when creating new

3. **Reuse existing helper functions** from both commands:
   - Use `get_artifact_path()` to check if UUID exists
   - Use existing artifact creation/update logic
   - Maintain the same output format (UUID for new, silent for append)

This approach would maintain backward compatibility while providing a more unified interface that aligns with the existing patterns in the codebase.
