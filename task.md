# Use makefile and ci

**Status:** Refining
**Agent PID:** 51736

## Original Todo

Use a makefile instead and make the GitHub Actions workflow ignore running when Markdown files change or you know, stuff in docs. Basically, you can look at the ~/Documents/momentum/ GitHub Actions workflow for example. Include make build, make lint, make test (for now if there are no tests, just return true)
